To execute this app, first change the userID variable in syncLocationActivityData.js to
the desired userID stored in the Users table. Then run the start.bat file that will set
environment variables concerning database access. In Windows, the machine may have to be
restarted for these environment variables to set. Alternatively if the environment
variables are already set, the command:

node javascript/syncLocationActivityData.js

may be run.
